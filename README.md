A  novel  post-authentication  approach  using  keystroke  dynamics,  a behavioral  biometric  that  analyzes  the  unique  typing  patterns  of  users.    

- Focusing  on parameters such as key press duration, flight time (the interval between key presses), and finger pressure, the  model  creates  an  individualized typing  profile for each user.
